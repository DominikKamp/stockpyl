Adding New Named Instances
==========================

(Run from ``src`` directory)

In ``build_instance_json.py``:

	* Make sure all the instances in the list of instances (at the bottom of the script, not in the function) are commented out.
	* Add instance to list of instances. 
	* Run the script.

In ``datasets/stockpyl_instances.json``, make sure instance was added.

Add entry to ``src/stockpyl/aux_files/named_instances.csv``.

Re-make docs.
